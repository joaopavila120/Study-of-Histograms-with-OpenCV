# Study-of-Histograms-with-OpenCV

– This is an application capable of:

• Loading two images, calculating, and displaying their respective histograms:
– One black and white or grayscale image
– One color image (BGR plot)
– PLUS: Save the histograms to a file (raw data)

• Load two other images with different shades of gray (if possible, depicting the same scene) and:

– Calculate and display their histograms
– Perform an equalization using the CDF method (equalizeHist) and another using the CLAHE method on these images
